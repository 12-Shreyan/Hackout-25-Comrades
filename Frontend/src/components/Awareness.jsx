          Mangroves are not just treesâ€”they are <strong>lifelines</strong> for our coasts, communities, and climate.
          They protect us from natural disasters, provide livelihoods, store carbon, and sustain biodiversity.
          By reporting threats and participating in BioGroves, you make a <strong>real-world impact</strong> on the environment and society.
